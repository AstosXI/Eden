# debuff

Allows players to cancel buffs/debuffs via a slash command.

I take NO credit for this addon.  I am NOT the creator.  I have edited this addon to add a simple command.  You can type '/showbuffs' in game to display the buff ID of your currently active buffs.  I find this useful for integrating with Ashitcast.  For example, finding the buff ID of utsusemi: Ni so I can cancel it in Ashitacast when casting Utsusemi: Ichi.  '/showbuffs' acts as a toggle.  Type it again to turn off the display.
